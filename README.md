# GrowingListView
The GrowingListView is a component designed to solve the problem of list view that occurs while inside the scroll view. The list does not grow in height being inside the scrollview  as the items are getting added. More than that this component is built in such a way that the developer who is familiar with recycler view can easily adopt to this.
